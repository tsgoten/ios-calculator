# iOS Calculator
This was a projected completed in September 2018 as the first project for my iOS Development Independent Study. 
### Lectures
I followed the first two lectures in [this series](https://youtu.be/_lRx1zoriPo) by Stanford University. 

The third lecture is worth watching as well, though the tutorial is outdated at the end. 

## this
This repository was mainly for me to save my work on the project, and to work at home, but it can serve as a reference to anyone else doing a similar iOS Independent Study.
